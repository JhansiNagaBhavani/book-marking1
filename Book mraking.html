      A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27,
      2015, Shillong) was an Indian scientist and politician who played a
      leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons
      programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. His scientific
      achievements and popularity gained him the epithets “Missile Man” and
      “People’s President.” Early life and career Kalam was born in a town in
      Tamil Nadu state to a fishing boat owner from a once wealthy family. The
      youngest of five siblings, Kalam persevered with his education despite his
      impoverished circumstances. He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering
      from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence
      Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the
      Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was project director
      of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed
      and produced in India. In 1980 SLV-III successfully released a satellite
      called Rohini into near-Earth orbit, taking India’s space program to the
      international stage. Kalam oversaw further development of launch vehicle
      technologies at ISRO, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.

    Achievement of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Abdul Kalam is one of the finest leaders
    of this country. He is admired for his achievements and led a very
    successful life. His way of living and his vision will continue to inspire
    people. Below is the list that tries to do honour to his countless
    achievements: In 1960, Dr Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development
    Organisation (DRDO) (DRDO) after he finished his graduation from the Madras
    Institute of Technology. In DRDO, Kalam was responsible for designing
    helicopters for the Indian Army. Dr Kalam was selected as the project
    director for SLV-III, India’s first indigenous satellite launch vehicle,
    after he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). After SLV-III
    was successful in launching the satellite Rohini to orbit in July 1980, Dr
    Kalam started expanding India’s space programme on a wider scale. Dr APJ
    Abdul Kalam’s Contribution to Missile Project Under his command, he had a
    team of India’s best soldiers. He simultaneously served as Prime Minister’s
    Chief Scientific Adviser from July 1992 to December 1999, and also the
    Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In
    1998, Kalam and Dr Soma Raju collaborated to design a low-cost coronary
    stent. The stent was dubbed the “Kalam-Raju Stent.” For rural health care,
    the “Kalam-Raju Tablet” was created in 2012. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
    1998 proved India’s nuclear capabilities. Without Dr Kalam’s assistance,
    this project would not have been possible. Such weapons, he explained to the
    international community, would serve solely as “weapons of peace” to
    discourage other countries from the annexation of Indian territory. As the
    leader of India’s missile programme in the 1980s, political parties came
    together in 2002 to elect APJ Abdul Kalam as the country’s eleventh
    president. A Well-Known Figure Around the World Some of the best speeches
    ever delivered at the United Nations and European Union can be found in his
    fervent speeches. Dr Kalam was appointed as a guest lecturer at the
    University of Delhi, after completion of his term as President As lecturer,
    he wrote extensively and supported a number of youth development
    initiatives. India as a mighty force is depicted in his works of fiction:
    Wings of Fire and India 2020. Throughout his life, he worked tirelessly to
    make the world a better place through his writings, lectures and other
    endeavours. Early Life and Education – Biography of APJ Abdul Kalam Dr APJ
    Abdul Kalam was an Indian aeronautical scientist who served as the country’s
    11th president from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in the city of
    Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, where he went on to study physics and aerospace
    engineering. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on October 15,
    1931, in Rameswaram, on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency, now in
    Tamil Nadu. Kalam was the youngest of five siblings. His ancestors had been
    affluent traders and landlords, owning enormous property holdings. Kalam’s
    family was impoverished in his early youth. Apart from the ancestral home,
    the family fortune and assets were lost with the building of the Pamban
    Bridge. The family came to be known as “Mara Kalam Iyakkivar” (later on
    reduced to “Marakier”), meaning wooden boat steerers, as the main family
    business was ferrying pilgrims. Kalam sold newspapers to support his family
    financially. APJ Abdul Kalam, the missile man of India and the former
    president, continues to be an inspiration to many people of all ages and
    from all backgrounds. His commitment to science and technology and his
    service to the country earned him the title “Missile Man of the Country.”
    The majority of individuals consider him to be their true inspiration.
    Conclusion Dr Kalam believed in the virtues of simplicity and elevated
    thinking. He was a true patriot, a man who believed in the empowerment of
    students and who built missiles while also advocating for peace and
    nonviolence. He was adamant that educational possibilities should be made
    available to all children since he believed this was the only way to
    alleviate poverty. Dr Kalam personified dignity and optimism as President.
    He is loved by people throughout the world for his simplicity in speech and
    behaviour. On July 27, 2015, Dr Kalam breathed his last in Shillong. But he
    is still remembered as one of the finest human beings and is an inspiration
    for many people worldwide
